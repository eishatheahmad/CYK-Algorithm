# CYK-Algorithm
program that implements the CYK algorithm

This program shall take two .txt files as input and shall produce two .txt files as output. All input and output .txt files shall be read from the same folder that contains your .cpp file. One input file shall be named CFG.txt and the other input file shall be named string.txt. One output file shall be named table.txt and the other output file shall be named result.txt.

CFG.txt shall contain the rules of the CFG in CNF. There shall be a maximum of 20 variables and all rules for a particular variable shall appear on a single line using compact/abbreviated/short-cut notation (e.g. A ïƒ  B | C | D), when needed. As per convention, the head (L. H. S.) of the top-most rule shall be the start variable. string.txt shall contain the string whose membership in the language of the CFG needs to be tested. The string shall consist of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 terminals. All terminals in this string shall belong to the set of terminals of the CFG.
